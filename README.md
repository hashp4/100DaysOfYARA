# ðŸš€100DaysOfYARA, what is it ?
The 100 Days of Yara is a challenge created by [Greg Lesnewich](https://twitter.com/greglesnewich). The goal of this challenge is to write one YARA rule everyday for 100 days in a row.

Each day, I will update this repo by:
- uploading one YARA rule
- updating this README to track my progression

## ðŸ¤”Why am I doing this ?
My journey into malware analysis *concretely* started last year. I focused mainly on static and dynamic analysis. Thus, I'm a beginner in writing YARA rules and I want to get better at it, both for my personal knowledge and the professional value it can have. My goal is to write qualitative YARA rules to be able to contribute to the [Unprotect.it](https://unprotect.it/) project which I find awesome. :)

## âŒ›Progression 
Below, you will find the current state of my progression. 

- [X] Day 1: YARA rule for WannaCry detection. The sample I used is from the PMAT course. You can find it [here](https://github.com/HuskyHacks/PMAT-labs/tree/main/labs/4-1.Bossfight-wannacry.exe).
- [X] Day 2 : YARA rule for process hollowing detection. This rule is based on the **sub-technique** T1055.012 that you can find on [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/).
